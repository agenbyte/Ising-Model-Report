\section{Introduction}
Given a lattice $\Lambda$ we let each lattice point take the value $-1$  or $1$
representing the spin configuration at that point. The Hamiltonian function for
the lattice is defined as
\[
    H(\sigma) = -\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle}J_{ij}\sigma_i\sigma_j
    -\mu\sum_{j}h_j\sigma_j
\]

Our first thing to do is a 2x2 simulation. We consider a ferromagnetic material
uniform interaction $J_{ij}=1$ for all $i,j$, and zero external field $\mu=0$.

\section{How we did stuff}
The first thing we did was set up a basic Ising simulation. It works fairly
well. We got some data and stuff and you can find it here. Specifically we
have some function. All the stuff we initially did was on a $32\times32$ grid
of points so we could iterate quickly.
